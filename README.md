A platform empowering users with self-sovereign identity through blockchain technology and decentralized storage. This project aims to provide a secure, transparent, and user-controlled way to manage and verify digital identities.

## Overview

In the current digital landscape, users often relinquish control of their personal data to centralized entities. This project leverages the power of blockchain (Ethereum), decentralized storage (IPFS), and cryptographic principles to create a system where individuals have full ownership and control over their identity attributes. Users can selectively disclose their information to verifiers without relying on a central authority.

## Key Features

* **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** Users own and control their identity data.
* **Blockchain Security:** Identity claims and verification statuses are anchored on the Ethereum blockchain for immutability and transparency.
* **Decentralized Storage:** Personal identity documents (encrypted) are stored on IPFS, not on a central server.
* **Selective Disclosure:** Users can choose what specific pieces of information to share for verification. (Future Goal)
* **Verifiable Credentials:** (Future Goal) Adherence to W3C standards for verifiable credentials and DIDs.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React for an accessible user experience.
* **MetaMask Integration:** Seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.

## Project Architecture

The system comprises the following key components:

1.  **Frontend (React Application):** The user interface that allows individuals to manage their identities, submit documents for verification, and approve/reject verification requests.
2.  **MetaMask:** A browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys, and sign transactions.
3.  **Smart Contracts (Solidity):** Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, these contracts manage:
    * User identity registration (e.g., mapping user addresses to identity identifiers).
    * Hashes of identity documents stored on IPFS.
    * Verification statuses and requests.
    * Access control logic.
4.  **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Used for decentralized storage of encrypted identity documents. Only the hash of the document is stored on the blockchain, ensuring privacy and reducing on-chain storage costs.


## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Version 18.x or later (LTS recommended). Download [here](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** or **yarn:** Included with Node.js or install yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
* **MetaMask:** Browser extension installed. Download [here](https://metamask.io/).
* **Git:** Version control system. Download [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ag863k/Decentralized-Identity-Verification.git](https://github.com/ag863k/Decentralized-Identity-Verification.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Decentralized-Identity-Verification
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Connect MetaMask:**
    * Open your MetaMask extension.
    * Ensure you are connected to a suitable Ethereum network (e.g., a testnet like Sepolia, or a local development network if you have one set up with Hardhat/Ganache).
    * *(Add specific instructions here if your DApp needs to be configured for a specific network or if smart contracts need to be deployed locally first).*

### Smart Contract Deployment (If applicable for local development)

*(This section needs to be filled based on your smart contract setup, e.g., using Hardhat or Truffle)*

* **Example for Hardhat (if you add it later):**
    1.  Navigate to the smart contract directory: `cd contracts` (or your contract path).
    2.  Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
    3.  Deploy to a local network: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
    4.  Ensure your frontend is configured to interact with the deployed contract addresses on the local network.

## Usage

*(Describe how a user interacts with your application. This can be high-level user stories.)*

1.  **User Registration:** New users connect their MetaMask wallet and create their decentralized identity profile.
2.  **Document Upload:** Users can upload identity documents (which are encrypted client-side) to IPFS. The resulting IPFS hash is associated with their identity on the blockchain.
3.  **Verification Request:** A verifier (e.g., an organization) can request access to specific identity attributes of a user.
4.  **User Consent:** The user receives the verification request and can approve or deny it through their wallet.
5.  **Data Sharing (Upon Approval):** If approved, the verifier gains temporary access to the requested (and decrypted) information.
6.  **Revocation:** Users can revoke access or credentials.

## Smart Contracts

The core logic of the identity system resides in Solidity smart contracts, typically located in the `/contracts` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist yet).

Key functionalities managed by smart contracts:
* Mapping user Ethereum addresses to their decentralized identity.
* Storing and managing IPFS hashes of (encrypted) identity documents.
* Handling verification requests and statuses.
* Access control mechanisms.

*(You will need to develop these contracts. Consider using OpenZeppelin libraries for security and standard patterns.)*

## IPFS Integration

IPFS is used for storing identity-related files off-chain in a decentralized manner.
* **Encryption:** All sensitive user data should be encrypted **client-side** before being uploaded to IPFS to ensure privacy. The user (or mechanisms controlled by the user) manages the encryption keys.
* **Hashing:** The IPFS hash (CID) of the encrypted data is stored on the blockchain, linking it to the user's identity.
* **Persistence:** To ensure data remains available on IPFS, consider using pinning services or running dedicated IPFS nodes.

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount for an identity verification system.
* **Smart Contract Audits:** Smart contracts should undergo rigorous testing and ideally a professional security audit before deployment to mainnet.
* **Data Encryption:** Strong end-to-end encryption for all sensitive user data stored on IPFS is crucial.
* **Private Key Management:** Users must be educated on the importance of securely managing their private keys. The application itself should not handle or store user private keys.
* **Input Validation:** All inputs (frontend and smart contracts) must be strictly validated.
* **Replay Attack Prevention:** Implement measures to prevent replay attacks.
* **Access Control:** Robust access control mechanisms within smart contracts are essential.
